Compiler:
- Arduino 1.6.12

Hardware: 
- LYT8266 Lamp

Arduino Settings:
- Generic ESP8266 Module
- CPU Frequency 80 Mhz
- Flash Size 1 M (64k SPIFFS)
  Due to the limited SPIFFS, the Javascript libraries are fetched from CDN or
  hosted at your site if you do not like CDNs

Note: HTTP Updater did not work reliable after a while, after adding three
      delays it finally works now very reliable. The change is in the file:
      .arduino15/packages/esp8266/hardware/esp8266/2.3.0/cores/esp8266/Updater.cpp

      ...
      bool UpdaterClass::_writeBuffer(){

      if(!_async) yield();
      delay(10);
      bool result = ESP.flashEraseSector(_currentAddress/FLASH_SECTOR_SIZE);
      if(!_async) yield();
      delay(10);
      if (result) {

      }
      if(!_async) yield();
